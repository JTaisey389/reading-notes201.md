### About Me
Hello everyone! My name is Jason Taisey and I come from the *Project Management* industry. In 2020 I realised that the career trajectory that  I was on did not make me happy, and I realised towards the end of 2020 that I needed to change. **Change** is what i did and I make the decision to leave my full time job as a *Project Manager* to go back to school full time.
