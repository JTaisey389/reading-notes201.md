# Code 201 Reading Notes

## Audio, Video, Images

### ***Images***
What we will cover in this section:
1. Controlling size of images in CSS
2. Aligning images in CSS
3. Adding background images

### Controlling size of images in CSS
- Within CSS you can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS. When you specify image sizes this helps the page to load more smoothly because you code loads before the images come up. 

### Aligning Images in CSS
- In the last chapter, you saw that using the float property can be used to move an element to the left or the right. Instead of using an img elements align attribute, web page authorâ€™s are increasingly using the float property to align images. 

- By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. To center an image you turn that part of your HTML code to a block level element. 

### Background Images
- The `background-image` property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default the image will repeat to fill the entire box. 

- Once you have added the background image there are a couple of ways to control how the image interacts within your webpage.
  1. Repeat: The image is repeated both horizontally and vertically.
  2. Repeat-x: The image is repeated horizontally 
  3. Reapeat-y: The image is repeated vertically
  4. No-repeat: The image will be shown once
  5. Fixed: The background image stays in the same position on the page
  6. Scroll: The background images moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down on the page.

### Background position
- When an image is not being repeated, you can use the `background-position` property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed. 

Examples: Left Top, Left Center, Left Bottom, Center top, Center Center, Center Bottom, Right top, Right Center, Right Bottom

### Image Rollovers & Sprites
- Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it. This is a rollover  and is a third style when a user clicks on the image. If the developer uses the same image repeatedly in different parts of the interface, it is known as a sprite.

### CSS3: Gradients
- With CSS3 this will introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. Depending on the web browser the code you right will dictate if the property will work within that webpage. 

- Additionally with gradients there is the ability to change the contrast of the background image.
  1. High Contrast: Most photographs have quite high contrast, which means that they are not ideal for a background image.
  2. Low Contrast: Image editing applications such as Photoshop have tools that allow you to manually adjust your images to a a lower contrast.
  3. Screen: To overlay text on an image with high contrast, you can place a semi-transparent background color behind the text to improve legibility. 

### ***Practical Information***
What we will cover in this section:
1. Search engine optimization
2. Using analytics to understand visitors
3. Putting your site on the web

### Search Engine Optimization
- SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. 

1. The Basics: SEO is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer to the top of search engine results. 
2. On page techniques: On page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines. The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine.
3. Off-Page techniques: Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. 

- In each page of your website there are seven  key places where keywords can appear in order to improve its find ability. 
1. Page title
2. URL/Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt text
7. Page Descriptions

### How to identify keywords and phrases
- Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO.

1. Brainstorm
2. Organize
3. Research
4. Compare 
5. Refine
6. Map

### Analytics
- As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving.

1. Signing up: Signing up for an analytics service
2. How it works: Every-time someone loads a page of your site, the tracking code sends date to the Google servers.
3. The tracking code: A tracking code is provided by Google Analytics for each website you are tracking. 

### How many people come to your site
- The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are likely to want to know. 

1. Number of visits
2. Unique visits
3. Page views
4. Pages per visit
5. Average time on site
6. Date selector
7. Export

### What are your visitors looking at
- The content link on the left-hand side allows you to learn more about what the visitors are looking at when they come to your site.

1. Pages will tell you which pages visitors are looking at the most.
2. Landing Pages: These are the pages that people arrive on when first visiting your site.
3. Top exit pages: this shows which pages people most commonly leave from.
