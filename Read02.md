### ***Text in HTML***
What we will cover is this section:

  1. Headings and Paragraphs**

  2. Bold, Italic, Emphasis**

  3. Structural and semantic markup

### Headings & Paragraphs 
As you create a web page, you add tags known as markup to the contents of the page. Tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
- *Structural markup*: Elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs. 
- *Semantic markup*: This provides extra information; such as where the emphasis is placed in a sentence. That is something you have written is a quotation and who said it, the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

### Headings
- In html you have a choice of six different headings. H1 is only used for main headings, you will only have a main heading as a best practice. H2 through H6 headings are classified as subheadings and varrying in height. Example of headings:
<h1>This is a main heading H1</h1>
<h2>This is a level two heading</h2>
<h3>Level three heading</h3>
<h4>Level four heading</h4>
<h5>Level five heading</h5>
<h6>Level six heading</h6>

### Paragraphs
- In order to create a paragraph, you would surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening `<p> tag and a closing </p>` tag. By default, a browser would show you each paragraph on a new line with some space between it. 

Example of paragraphs:
<p>I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. It's not personal. It's in business. Mr. Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, very sacred religious relationship. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you</p>

<p>What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless.</p>

### Bold & Italic
- Once you have created a paragraph some users may want to add additional emphasis on words, sentences, or possibly the whole paragraph. These are just two options that you could use, but there are so many more at your disposal. As a reminder, you have to have an opening tag and a closing tag. 

Examples of using bold & italics: `<b> & </b> Bold Tag, <i> & </i> Italic tag`
<p>What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? <b>"Oh, what do I do?</b> What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I don't like violence, Tom.</p>

<p>Augue neque gravida in fermentum et sollicitudin ac orci phasellus. <i> In pellentesque massa placerat duis ultricies lacus sed.</i> Amet volutpat consequat mauris nunc congue.</p>

### Superscript & Subscript
- Superscript and subscripts are a wonderful way that you can increase the functionality of your text. For example, if you wanted to talk about E=MC2 a superscript would help you write that. The same would apply to subscript and as an example, we will use CO2.

### White Space
- For code to be easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines. 

Examples of white space: The whitespace will display each of the paragraphs and make it easier for the user to read. 
`<p>Why is the grass green?</p>`
`<p>How does the wind blow?</p>`
`<p>Does Jim know his pumpkins are safe?</p>`

### Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
- Similar to white space line breaks and horizontal rules are a great tool for   displaying the information to the user in a different way.


### Visual Editors & Their Code Views
- Content management systems and HTML editors such as VS Code usually have two views of the page you are creating. A visual editor and a code view. 

Visual editors are similar to word processors. Each editor will differ slightly, there are some features that are common to most editors that allow you to control the presentation of text. 

Code views show you the code created by the visual editor so you can manually edit it, or so you can just enter new code yourself. All of the content on this page I have been editing in a code view and previewing with the visual editor. 

### Semantic Markup
- Some text elements are not affected by the structure of your webpages, but they do add extra information to the pages. They are known as semantic markup, the latter part will cover semantic markup.
