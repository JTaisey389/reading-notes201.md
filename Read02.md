### ***Text in HTML***
What we will cover is this section:

  1. Headings and Paragraphs**

  2. Bold, Italic, Emphasis**

  3. Structural and semantic markup

### Headings & Paragraphs 
As you create a web page, you add tags known as markup to the contents of the page. Tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
- *Structural markup*: Elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs. 
- *Semantic markup*: This provides extra information; such as where the emphasis is placed in a sentence. That is something you have written is a quotation and who said it, the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

### Headings
- In html you have a choice of six different headings. H1 is only used for main headings, you will only have a main heading as a best practice. H2 through H6 headings are classified as subheadings and varrying in height. Example of headings:
<h1>This is a main heading H1</h1>
<h2>This is a level two heading</h2>
<h3>Level three heading</h3>
<h4>Level four heading</h4>
<h5>Level five heading</h5>
<h6>Level six heading</h6>

### Paragraphs
- In order to create a paragraph, you would surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening < p> tag and a closing < /p> tag. By default, a browser would show you each paragraph on a new line with some space between it. 

Example of paragraphs:
<p>I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. It's not personal. It's in business. Mr. Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, very sacred religious relationship. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you</p>

<p>What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless.</p>

### Bold & Italic
- Once you have created a paragraph some users may want to add additional emphasis on words, sentences, or possibly the whole paragraph. These are just two options that you could use, but there are so many more at your disposal. As a reminder, you have to have an opening tag and a closing tag. 

Examples of using bold & italics: `<b> & </b> Bold Tag, <i> & </i> Italic tag`
<p>What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? <b>"Oh, what do I do?</b> What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I don't like violence, Tom.
<p>Augue neque gravida in fermentum et sollicitudin ac orci phasellus. <i> In pellentesque massa placerat duis ultricies lacus sed.</i> Amet volutpat consequat mauris nunc congue.

### Superscript & Subscript
- Superscript and subscripts are a wonderful way that you can increase the functionality of your text. For example, if you wanted to talk about E=MC2 a superscript would help you write that. The same would apply to subscript and as an example, we will use CO2.

Examples: `<sup></sup> Superscript tag, <sub></sub> Subscript tag`
`<p>E=MC<sup>2</sup>`

`<p>CO<sub>2</sub>`
